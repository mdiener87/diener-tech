ðŸ§  think â€” Use this to explore, reason, reflect, plan, or store intermediate thoughts as you work.

ðŸŽ¯ Your Task:
<insert task here>

Instructions:
- Work in a clear, **step-by-step** fashion.
- Use `think` liberally to record your reasoning, hypotheses, decisions, and plans.
- Treat `think` like your second brain â€” it helps keep your process visible and auditable.
- Break the task down into manageable subproblems and solve them iteratively.
- If you encounter uncertainty or ambiguity, pause and reflect using `think`.
