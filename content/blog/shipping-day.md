## Out the Door

I was out to dinner with my girlfriend. She had been food primed for breadsticks earlier in the day, and so our impromptu dinner plans quickly centered on this stable Italian restaurant. Over pasta and wine, I was incessantly discussing my latest develop progress on DienerTech. Over the last few months, I'd developed insane levels of project energy. Normally its difficult to meaningfully code in one's spare time. After working on software all day in my day job, its helpful - even healthy! - to touch grass. Or baring that, at least playing a video game or something. Doubling down on coding is *hard*. Especially if that coding isn't a trivial toy example, but a meaningful project. Such as a personal website you hope to establish your own branding behind! Nonetheless, I'd been bit by the project bug. I was obsessed. I put in some long days, and numerous commits, into this project. I could feel it nearing completion. Perhaps another week or two of work. My girlfriend, ever wise, simply suggested - "Why not launch it tonight? It's ready!"

You know what? She was right. It *was* ready. Or, almost ready at any rate. It would take me the rest of the night, but I launched my website on Cloudflare that night. Building and launching a project is an incredible feeling. While I work on code all day long, these projects are largely already live. Its ongoing work, not the first flight. This was a first flight of my own making, and it was incredibly exciting!

Of course, there were some bumps discovered shortly after takeoff. These include:
1) The Cloudflare Analytics engine wasn't correctly recording data. 
2) The contact page was completely broken. Even worse - it would claim contact submissions had succeeded.
