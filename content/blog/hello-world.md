## Hello World!

These are the iconic first words every new developer learns to code ‚Äî and every new system logs. So too are they this website's first words. I am very excited for [DienerTech](https://www.diener.tech), my personal website, to now go live. This website is now years in the making. I've wanted to build my own personal website for years. However, as a software engineer working in the tech industry, finding the time, motivation, and mental bandwidth to build such a site has proved a difficult challenge. Luckily, the tooling for software development has never before been as powerful and robust as it is today. Likewise, my personal motivation for growing and engaging as an engineer has never been greater than it is now. 

So with motivation in one hand, and software in the other, I finally can bring this website to life. With extensive frontend engineering experience, building a website from a low-code or no-code platform wouldn't satisfy my personal vision (read: hyper-fixated perfectionism).

I started my career a decade ago with a blog. Hosted on Wordpress, it was a fraction of the sophistication of DienerTech. I was brand-new to programming as a career, and I cataloged a very raw and personal journey towards self-actualization. Eventually, the blog had served its purpose, and I let it drop. My personally-directed and desperately-motivated studies in programming had borne fruit: I had found not just a career for myself in software engineering, but I'd also finally found myself.

So over the past decade, I have lived, and worked, and grown. I have fallen in love, and I have endured devastating heartbreak. I have put in the long hours on difficult projects, and I have jumped teams and companies alike for better opportunities. I survived the pandemic alone, and I have found lifelong friends. Hell, I even got my first tattoo!

Now with that decade of career experience and life experience squarely under my belt, I return to blogging. Moreover, I return to *creating* üë®‚Äçüíª

**Hello, World!** Welcome to DienerTech! Please enjoy your stay ‚Äî and stay tuned for insights, technical deep dives, and reflections on my ongoing journey.
