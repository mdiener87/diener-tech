## Hello World!

These are the famous first words for any new developer to code, or for any new system to log out. So too are they this website's first words. I am very excited for [DienerTech](https://www.diener.tech), my personal website, to now go live. This website is now years in the making. I have had the desire to build my own, personal website for some time now. However, as a software engineer working in the tech industry, finding the time, motivation, and mental bandwidth to build such a site has proved a difficult challenge. Luckily, the tooling for software development has never before been as powerful and robust as it is today. Likewise, my personal motivation for growing and engaging as an engineer has never been greater than it is now. 

So with motivation in one hand, and software in the other, I finally can bring this website to life. I have extensive experience in frontend engineering, and so building a website from a low-code or no-code platform just wouldn't meet my personal vision for this platform. (*consulting hat*üß¢ - modern website services are great, and they probably would meet your needs if you just want to get blogging right away!). It is an incredible delight to not just experiment with these new tools, but to bring this longstanding vision for my website to life.

I started my career a decade ago with a blog. Hosted on Wordpress, it was a fraction of the sophistication of diener.tech. I was brand-new to programming as a career, and I cataloged a very raw and personal journey towards self-actualization. Eventually, the blog had served its purpose, and I let it drop. My personally directed and desperately motivated studies in programming had borne fruit: I had found not just a career for myself in software, but I'd also finally found myself. So for the last decade, I have lived, and worked, and grown. I have fallen in love, and I have endured devastating heartbreak. I have put in the long hours on difficult projects, and I have jumped teams and companies alike for better opportunities. I survived the pandemic alone, and I have found lifelong friends. Hell, I even got my first tattoo!

Now with a decade of career experience and life experience under my belt, I return to blogging. Moreover, I return to *creating* üë®‚Äçüíª. So **hello, world!** Welcome to diener.tech! Please enjoy your stay!!
