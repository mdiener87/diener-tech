## Fall Vibes

As summer begins its slow fade into fall, it feels good to return to some personal projects and blogging. This summer was full of camping, adventures, and the conclusion of a recent re-watch of Star Trek: Voyager [link]. ST:V is one of my favorite sci-fi shows. I was a kid when it was airing on UPN, and it was definitley the millienal's star trek. Star Trek: The Next Generation is of course a classic, but it belonged more to my Dad than I. Deep Space Nine had the most world-building of any Trek, but it was a bit too dense for a kid to parse. Voyager, meanwhile, was the perfect blend of advancing CGI, an instantly accessible plot, and unhinged Captain Janeway doing whatever it takes to get her crew home (short of, you know, actually *getting her crew home*).

I have a personal bit of fan head cannon involving Voyager. It begins in a late Season 5 episode - Think Tank ([link]). An enigmatic collection of brilliant aliens go around solving intractable problems for others - but for a price. Turns out, many of the problems they solve were started by them so as to engineer their desired payment. with a little Borg-inspired cheating (turns out, cheating is a more efficent strategy) Voyager manages to outthink the think tank, and escape the episode's quandry. 

As part of the cast of the think tank, one in particular always stood out to me. This little guy right here - the so called 'Artificial Intelligence':

One of the Think Tank's members, this AI named... 'AI', would have very little screen time. It also proved to be a bit of a security threat, as an interlink with Seven would lead to the Think Tanks downfall. Here is where this get's interesting - the Artificial Intelligence would show up several more times throughout the series. Apparently someone in the props department was fond of their work here, and it became a recuring background prop found in several other episodes. Voyager was a bit notorious for this. While the later seasons would sometimes feature complex CGI, much of the special effects on the show were practical. A good alien server rack isn't lightly discarded!

## The Conspiracy

So here's where I get out my red ball of twine and start to make a mess of my office wall. My head cannon goes like this: The Artificial Intelligence, having lost its home in the Think Tank, swore itself to vengance. It would seek out Voyager, and ensure its destruction! As it is what amounts to an alien server rack, the Artificial Intelligence is entirely immobile. In fact, it doesn't even appear to be able to speak (a bit of a miss in a world with a universal translator)! If it is to seek out its vengance, it will have to manipulate others to this effect. Perhaps it hacks into shipping manifests, ensuring its delivery to the next ship or port of call. Or perhaps it sends large quantities of spam emails, seeking out the naive and gulliable in this quadrant of thieves. Whatever the case, it is clearly succesful - the Artificial Intelligence can be found again and again in the background of Voyager. While it will never achieve the vengance it seeks, it certainally tries again and again!

There's just one flaw in my headcannon - I don't actually have a listing of which episodes the Artificial Intelligence appears in. I know it appears in the background as an unnamed prop in several episodes following Think Tank. However, memory alpha has no catalog of its appearances. If the official Fandom doesn't have it, you know you're in deep!

So, one way to solve this problem would just be to scan the episodes on like, 2-4x speed. It might take a few hours of semi-attentive watching, but it would be fairly straightforward to find all of the uses of this prop. There are 56 episodes total to search. This includes 6 episodes following Think Tank (season 5, episodes 21-26), 26 episodes in Season 6, and 24 episodes in season 7. That's a reasonable amount of episodes to search through by hand. 

Or... we could take an entirely unreasonable approach. In our search for the Artificial Intelligence, we could employ our own, modern, AI. This would elevate our quest from mere fan-theory to ironical overkill, and that's the best kind of fandom! A Trekkie, looking to prove his obscure fan theory involving AIs, *with* AI?

## Set a New Course

This ultra-conspiritorial fan theory has led me to create Frame Finder [link]. The objective? To build an analysis engine that could take a reference image, and search the extracted frames of provided video content for a match. With such a project, I can quickly scan the Voyager episodes for instances where the Artificial Intelligence - or any other prop - might appear in.
